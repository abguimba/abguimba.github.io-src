As beautiful as a shell 2.0
@42Born2Code
We had to start from our minishell and make it stronger to get little by little closer to a real functionnal shell. We added couple of features such as multi-command management, redirections as well as line edition that will allow you to use arrows for example.
Note: We used our 42sh to turn in our 42sh, and our 21sh.</description>

The ultimate shell
@42Born2Code
The last and hardest of the shell projects. We were asked, in a team of at least 4 people. To build a shell that incorporated a lot of modern shell functions, such as job control, globbing, inhibitors, scripting, perfect line management, signal handling, heredoc management, perfect piping and fd redirections, alias and complete environment management, history, autocompletion, syntax highlighting, POXIS builtins, abstract syntax trees, parser, lexer, binary hashing, etc&amp;hellip;</description>

Now, you’re thinking with containers&amp;hellip;
@42Born2Code
A really vast introduction to the world of Docker. From learning the insights of this powerful tool and containerization itself, to the usage of advanced Dockerfiles, to deploying our own CI platform through a Dockerfile.

Can you feel it?
@42Born2Code
Fillit is a project that lets you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.</description>

First take at UnitTesting
@42Born2Code
This project required to work in a duo. We were asked to build a simplified version of a battery of UnitTests.
We were required to use it to test one of our previous projects. We chose my libft.
Try it on Github!
Just a simple
$/&amp;gt; make test  inside of a folder with some functions/executable to check inside of the realtests/ folder will compile the whole framework and start the testing for you.</description>

INITiation to DevOps life
@42Born2Code
This first project, init, will give you the opportunity to discover system and network basic commands, many of the services used on a server machine, as well as a few ideas of scripts that can be useful for SysAdmins on a daily basis.
