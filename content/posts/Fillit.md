_Can you feel it?_

@42Born2Code

Fillit is a project that lets you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square. A Tetriminosis a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

You'll have to arrange all the Tetris pieces in the smallest possible "square".
