_The ultimate shell_

@42Born2Code


The last and hardest of the shell projects. We were asked, in a team of at least 4 people. To build a shell that incorporated a lot of modern shell functions, such as job control, globbing, inhibitors, scripting, perfect line management, signal handling, heredoc management, perfect piping and fd redirections, alias and complete environment management, history, autocompletion, syntax highlighting, POXIS builtins, abstract syntax trees, parser, lexer, binary hashing, etc...
