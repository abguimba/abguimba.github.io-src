_First take at UnitTesting_

@42Born2Code

This project required to work in a duo. We were asked to build a simplified version of a battery of UnitTests.

We were required to use it to test one of our previous projects. We chose my [libft](https://github.com/abguimba/42-libft).

[Try it on Github!](https://github.com/abguimba/42-libunit)  
  
  
Just a simple


    $ make test

inside of a folder with some functions/executable to check inside of the realtests/ folder will compile the whole framework and start the testing for you.
I included my own test files from my libft.
