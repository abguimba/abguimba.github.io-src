_As beautiful as a shell 2.0_

@42Born2Code

We had to start from our minishell and make it stronger to get little by little closer to a real functionnal shell. We added couple of features such as multi-command management, redirections as well as line edition that will allow you to use arrows for example.

Note: We used our 42sh to turn in our 42sh, and our 21sh. So you'll find really similar files in both repos.

Just a simple
    
    $/> make

should be enough to get you started with an executable.
